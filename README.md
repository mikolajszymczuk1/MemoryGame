# How to setup project

## Requirements

* SFML library installed

## My workflow

When i wrote this app, i used g++ on linux to compile project but you can use any other C++ compiler you want.

## Linux

I created short script to speed up compile process, you can run it and build project by enter this command in terminal:

```
./build.sh
```

## Windows

On windows you can compile project by following these documentation: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/#getting-started
